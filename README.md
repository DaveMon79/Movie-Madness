## Description

This application allows the user to view movies and series details including the ratings and trailer.

* When a user clicks on the search icon on the homepage, then the user is presented with a modal window to search by movie or IMDbid.
* A user can search for movie details using the movie title and year of release.
* A user can also search for movie details using the IMDb id.
* When a user clicks on the search button, then they are directed to the results page.
* The results page includes the trailer, plot, ratings, movie title and movie image.
* A user can go back to the homepage by clicking on the home button on the top left corner of the results page.

## Project plan

We were assigned to a group of five and given a project to design and create a website, which had to inculde the following functionalities:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
* Must be responsive to user input
* Use at least two server-side API's 
* Utilise client side storage
* Use a modal pop-up



## Actions taken 

As a group we sat down and reviewed the API's at our disposal. We decided on a movie search website which used the OMDB and You Tube API's. 

* OMDB - returned the movie name, plot, ratings (IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes etc), boxset image and You Tube id for the movie trailer
* You Tube - Using the ID from the OMDB API call, we were able to display the movie trailer on You Tube

We then broke the task down in to sections and assigned each person with a list of tasks to complete.

* Beji Oritsegidenene - CSS, HTML for search page and javascript
* Mike Hui - Javascript, You Tube API call function
* Catherine Au - Javascript, display OMDB data function & modal  
* Abdela Hersi - Javascript, OMDB API call, autoSearch function
* Dave Monaghan - CSS, HTML for results page & READme file



## Code Style

* HTML 
* CSS
* Javascript

# Testing
* The code was then checked at the following website for the web accessibility and the markup
    * https://wave.webaim.org/
    * https://validator.w3.org/

## Difficulties

The main difficulties we experienced on this project were for the API calls, and javascript to make them function as we'd envisaged.


## Success

We were able to complete the project using all the funtionalties we planned to incorperate, but our main success was how well worked together as a team.

Each team member displayed these attributes:

* Excellent commincation
* Always on hand to support others when required
* Work ethic
* Knowledge to complete the project
